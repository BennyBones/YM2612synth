# YM2612synth
Extended documentation of Alex-morel's ym2612 project

I bought two of these Yamaha YM2612 chips with the plan to make a glorious 90's sounding arcade synth engine but I was finding it hard to find all the documentation to make these little things work.

After doing some internet digging, jumping from google to youtube to twitter and back again I came across some code by Alex-morel. All the basics seemed to be there but there really wasn't any documentation along with it. I did a little digging into the code and worked out how the chip and arduino are meant to be wired together. Ideally I am looking into adding a small amp to push the output levels to something that can be heard with headphones.
